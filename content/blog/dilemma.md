Let’s take a moment and ponder the existential crisis of an infinite series. It’s the age-old question: Can something that never ends ever really *settle down*? Does it converge to something nice and neat, or does it keep spiraling out of control, like an endless Twitter thread?

Today, we’re tackling this burning question with some calculus, but don’t worry—I’ll keep it light, fun, and packed with *delicious* math.

**Theorem.** *If $a_n$ is a sequence such that the limit of the partial sums $S_n = a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_n$ exists, then the series $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n$ converges to that limit. But if the limit doesn’t exist, the series goes to the dark abyss of divergence—like that one relative who never stops talking at family gatherings.*

*Proof-ish.* Let’s begin by acknowledging that infinity, in all its glory, can be a tricky beast. But once you know its boundaries (literally), it’s like walking a tightrope—thrilling, yet mathematical. So, we begin with the **partial sum** of a series, $S_n$, which is just the sum of the first $n$ terms:

$$
S_n = a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_n.
$$

Now, if our sequence is nice (and by nice, I mean well-behaved), we should expect that these partial sums, $S_n$, start getting closer and closer to a particular value as $n$ increases. Imagine them inching toward a magical number $L$—a nice, tidy destination. Mathematically, we say:

$$
\lim_{n \to \infty} S_n = L.
$$

If that happens, then—*brace yourself*—the series **converges** to $L$. Everything is stable, calm, and mathematical peace reigns.

But if, on the other hand, the partial sums just keep getting bigger and bigger (or oscillate around in an unholy dance), then we know the series is headed for **divergence**. The limit, instead of gracefully approaching a point, simply can’t make up its mind, like trying to settle on a Netflix show to watch.

Let’s take a quick example. Consider the series:

$$
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n}.
$$

You might recognize this as the **harmonic series**. As you add more and more terms, it just keeps growing. It doesn’t matter how big $n$ gets, the sum keeps getting larger. It’s like the Energizer Bunny—except instead of a battery, it’s your patience running out.

Mathematically, we say the partial sums $S_n = 1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \cdots + \frac{1}{n}$ grow without bound. The limit of $S_n$ does not exist, and therefore, the harmonic series **diverges**. No tidy sum here, folks—just infinite chaos!

On the flip side, take the series:

$$
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^2}.
$$

This one is much better behaved. The terms decrease quickly enough, and guess what? The partial sums approach a finite value as $n$ grows larger. In fact, this series converges to **$\frac{\pi^2}{6}$** (an elegant result that’s been kicking around since Euler was in diapers).

So, as you can see, the infinite series has two distinct personalities: the well-behaved, convergent types that settle down into neat sums, and the wild, divergent ones that never know when to quit. It’s like the difference between a relaxing Sunday afternoon and a party that never ends.

**Conclusion:** Infinity, with all its endless promises, is a bit of a wild card. But by watching the behavior of partial sums, we can tell whether an infinite series is worth our time (convergent) or whether we should just move on (divergent). Calculus, in all its infinite wisdom, helps us navigate this mathematical existentialism with just enough certainty to avoid an existential meltdown. {{ qed() }}
